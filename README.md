Pi home Improvements

Thak you for your interest in this projects.

I am currenlty trying to learn python and GPIO contorl with the raspberry pi.
This repository is to help me keep version controls and keep track of tests and examples.

It is not expected to be downloaded by others and is of little use.  
No support is provided but, if it proves useful, I'm glad I could help ;-)
